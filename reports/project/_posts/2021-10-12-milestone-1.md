<center><h2>Question 1</h2></center>

#### Question 1.1

SV% is a metric that favors goalies with the least time spent on the ice, so with the least number of shots received.
When a goalie receives a low number of shots, the probabilities that it stops all of them is high.
We can see this in practice on the dataframe of the next section. The goalies wich played only one game have the highest SV% score wich is 100 %.

To produce a better statistic we can add others criterias, such as the Time On Ice (MIN), the number of games played (GP), or the number of received shots.
See section : Question 1.3

#### Question 1.2

Below we have the dataframe and the plot of twenty (20) best goalies for the NHL 2017-2018 season, only based on the SV% score.

#### Question 1.3

Question 1.3.a

Below, the first criteria used to rank goalies is Time On Ice (MIN), and the second is the number of games played (GP).
With this feature selection, we were able to reproduce the official seven (7) best goalies for the NHL 2017-2018 season (with some badly ranked).

{% include 20_best_goalies_MIN_GP_SV_2017-2018_fig.html %}

Question 1.3.a

Another solution proposed by a teammate was to first filter the goalies by which received a certain number of shots, before applying the SV% filter.
This would remove new recruits giving us a more realistic ranking. By inspection, defining a threshold of 400 shots excludes new recruits but keeps rising stars in the dataset.

As mentionned previously, the number of shots received is an important feature to determine rapidly if we have enough data to quantify the goalies level of skill. Similarly, the number of games won relative to the number of games played as well as the number of games played alone can help determine how good a goalie is. Finally, more involved metrics that compare the goalies performance to the league average (e.g. the relative goal against average GA%-) are very useful in determining the quality of a goalies performance over a season.

When applying this threshold filtering, we have a drastically modified top 20 goalies by SV% ranking presented in the following figure.

<center><h2>Question 2</h2></center>

In this question we provide a tutorial on how to download specific NHL play-by-play data from the NHL play-by-play API using our custom Python functions. Downloading NHL play-by-play data requires the use of a single function call.

```python
from ift6758.question_2 import nhl_data
year = [2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020]  # Specify all desired seasons
gametypes = ['02', '03']  # Specify all desired game types
path = '/path/to/local/copy/of/nhl_data'  # Path to local database
nhl_pbp_data = nhl_data(year, gametypes, path, light=False)
```
Where `year` and `gametypes` are lists of NHL season years and gametypes is a list of NHL game types. Using `year = [2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020]` and `gametypes = ['02', '03']` downloads all non-empty (played), NHL regular season and NHL playoff games from the 2016-2017 through to the 2020-2021 NHL seasons.

This function relies on two helper functions that can be used to customize the game data being downloaded. To download a list of specific game IDs, the `getData` can be used as follows:

```python
# This can be any list of regular season or playoff game IDs.
IDs = ['20180203', '20200212']
nhl_pbp_data = getData(IDs, path, light=False)
```

In addition, the `getData` and `nhl_data` functions can also serve to filter a list of game IDs such that valid game IDs associated to played games are returned from a raw game ID list. This is useful if we want to load the game data in a loop instead of as one large dictionnary to reduce the amount of memory used. To obtain a list of valid played game IDs specify `light=True` as follows:

```python
year = [2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020]
gametypes = ['02', '03']
path = '/path/to/local/copy/of/nhl_data'
IDs = ['0', '2017020025', '2016030155']

# All playoff games that were not played will be filtered out.
nhl_pbp_IDs = nhl_data(year, gametypes, path, light=True)

# '0' will be filtered out because it is invalid.
# '2016030155' will be filtered out, this playoff game was not played.
nhl_pbp_IDs = getData(IDs, path, light=True)
```

Finally, to use `nhl_data` without surprises, it is important to note the following:

- `nhl_data` always downloads game data of valid played game IDs to the database if the database did not contain it.
- `nhl_data` will throw an error if asked for game types other than `'02'` and/or `'03'`.
- `nhl_data` only queries the NHL API for valid game IDs. I.e. this is not a brute force implementation (see code documentation for the nitty-gritty details).

<center><h2>Question 3</h2></center>

A screenshot of the implemented ipywidget is presented in the following figure. This ipywidget is a flexible tool designed to facilitate the exploration of specific game data. To use the tool, specify the season and game type studied. Then slide through the games and through the game events to easily gain intuition on the game data. The tool shows the game venue, team matchup, game date, game time, a summary of the event information and the coordinate of the individual game events on the ice rink.

When changing a season year or type, there is some seconds of delay before new data being displayed. It is due to the data loading.
An automatic player is also placed to help going through the events. It will continue to play even if the season or the game manually change.
When changing season or game all the related sliders (games and events for seasons, and events for games) will be reset to zero (0).
Notice that for some events like "Period Start" there is no coordinate to plot. So the ice figure will still remain, but there will be no point shown. Also notice the tricode of each playing team will be display at left or right respectively to his goal side.

Question 4.1

Here is a sample of ten (10) rows of the proposed dataset :
{% include 2020-2021_season_shots_and_goals_events.html %}

Question 4.2

For this milestone, the information about the power play is given by two (2) boolean features : "Home Team Shorthanded" and "Away Team Shorthanded".They have be retrieved from the periods info, with the period number in each event.

For a further milestone, with the two previous informations we already have (home and away team shorthanded info).
We'll be able to give the real power play number, i.e. 5 on 4, by getting it in the "liveData" -> "linescore" -> "powerPlayStrength" part of the json given by the API.

Question 4.3

Some additional features that we could consider creating for Shots and Goals events can be :
- Classify a shot or a goal as a rebound or a shot off the rush, by adding the number of "Assist" player(s) for the event.
- The event period type can helps to determine the percentage of games ended after regular period.
- The indicator of if it's a "Game Winning Goal" or not. It can helps determine how early most of the games are won.

### 5-1

![5-1](/assets/5-1.png)

We can see from the first graph that the *Wrist Shot* is by far the most used shot by teams in the 2018/2019 season with almost 50,000 attempts. However, it is not the most dangerous shot. In fact, thanks to the second graph, we see that the *Tip-in* has a percentage of shots converted into goals of about 17%. The *Wrist Shot* has only a 9% conversion rate.

### 5-2

![5-2](/assets/5-2.png)

Comparing the ratios of goals over total shots we see that they are quite similar over the 3 seasons from 2018 to 2021. Note that we decided not to use the data of shots/goals beyond 90ft because the number of shots was much too low and not representative for the goals/shots conversion ratio.

### 5-3

![5-3](/assets/5-3.png)

This heatmap allows us to obtain the different ratios of goals over total shots attempted for the 2018-2019 season according to two parameters: the distance of shots discretized on 15ft intervals and the type of shot attempted. Note again that we decided not to take into account shots beyond 90ft as well as configurations for which the number of shots was not higher than 30. These would have shown potentially very high ratios and not representative of an entire season. Following this and thanks to the heatmap presented, we can identify the 2 most dangerous configurations: the *Slap Shot* and the *Snap Shot* at a distance of 15ft maximum. These have a conversion ratio of about 22%.
